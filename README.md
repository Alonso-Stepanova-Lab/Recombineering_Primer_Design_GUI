# Recombineering_Primer_Design_GUI
This MatLab GUI allows for the identification of a TAC clone containing the gene of interest (in Arabidopsis) and to design all the primers needed for a typical tagging and trimming experiment.
All the included files should be in the same folder and you need to have MatLab 2017a or older installed in your computer.
All you need to do is to run the script 'PrimersRecombineeringGUI.m
You can either enter the name of a gene of interest, or load a file with a list of genes of interest. 
You can also select a series of parameters such as position of the tag or the melting temperature of your testing primers.
